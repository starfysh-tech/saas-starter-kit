# SaaS Starter Kit - Architecture Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive architecture documentation for the SaaS Starter Kit following the C4 Model and Arc42 documentation framework.

## Documentation Structure

### Level 1: System Context

- [System Context](01-system-context.md) - High-level system overview and external dependencies
- [Stakeholders and External Systems](01-stakeholders.md) - User personas and external integrations

### Level 2: Container Architecture

- [Container Architecture](02-container-architecture.md) - High-level technology choices and system decomposition
- [Deployment Architecture](02-deployment-architecture.md) - Infrastructure and deployment patterns

### Level 3: Component Architecture

- [Component Architecture](03-component-architecture.md) - Internal component structure and relationships
- [API Architecture](03-api-architecture.md) - API design patterns and endpoint organization

### Level 4: Code Architecture

- [Code Organization](04-code-organization.md) - Directory structure and module organization
- [Design Patterns](04-design-patterns.md) - Implementation patterns and conventions

### Cross-Cutting Concerns

- [Data Architecture](data-architecture.md) - Database design, data models, and data flows
- [Security Architecture](security-architecture.md) - Authentication, authorization, and security patterns
- [Integration Architecture](integration-architecture.md) - Third-party service integrations
- [Quality Attributes](quality-attributes.md) - Performance, scalability, reliability considerations

### Architecture Decision Records

- [ADR Directory](adr/) - Architecture Decision Records documenting key decisions

## Diagramming Standards

All diagrams follow these conventions:

- **Mermaid syntax** for version-controlled diagrams
- **C4 Model notation** for system, container, component, and code views
- **PlantUML** for detailed sequence and class diagrams where needed
- **Consistent color coding** across all diagrams

## Maintenance

This documentation should be updated when:

- New major features are added
- External integrations change
- Security or compliance requirements change
- Performance characteristics significantly change
- Architecture decisions are made that affect system design

## Quick Start

1. Start with [System Context](01-system-context.md) for high-level overview
2. Review [Container Architecture](02-container-architecture.md) for technology choices
3. Deep dive into [Component Architecture](03-component-architecture.md) for implementation details
4. Check [Security Architecture](security-architecture.md) for security considerations

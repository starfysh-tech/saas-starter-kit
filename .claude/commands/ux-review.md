Conduct comprehensive UX review and optimization:

1. **Analyze existing features** for UX issues and improvement opportunities
2. **Review accessibility** compliance (WCAG, keyboard nav, screen readers)
3. **Evaluate user flows** for friction points and conversion optimization
4. **Assess design consistency** with established patterns

Focus areas:
- Visual hierarchy and information architecture
- Responsive design across devices
- Loading states and error handling
- Interactive element states
- Cognitive load and user mental models

Output format:
- Executive summary of key findings
- Prioritized recommendations (high/medium/low)
- Specific implementation guidance
- Accessibility compliance gaps
- Quick wins vs long-term improvements

Use when:
- Features need UX optimization
- Accessibility issues identified
- User experience problems reported
- Design consistency review needed

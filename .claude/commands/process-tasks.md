If not told which task file to use:
- Look under `/features/` for files starting with `tasks-`
- Ask me to select from available options by providing a number

Always ask me to confirm the task file name before proceeding.

Review the corresponding PRD file where the parts after `prd-` and `tasks-prd-` match to understand the feature requirements.

Process the task list using .agents/flows/process-task-list.md

First, read the task file to understand current progress, then start or resume work. Use subagents.
